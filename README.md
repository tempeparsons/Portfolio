## About me

I am laboratory scientist turned bioinformatician, with a specialism in all types of mass spectrometry data.  
I love programming Python and am endlessly fascinated by patterns in data, and the power of these patterns to improve the world around us.   
If you want to know more, please check out my Publications page and watch this space for links to software I'm writing, tutorials and forthcoming publications.
